# PPNM - Practical Programming and Numerical Methods

This repository is dedicated to the course "Practical Programming and Numerical Methods", which focuses on applying programming techniques and numerical methods to solve mathematical problems. The course is offering students the flexibility to choose a programming language of their choice for completing the assignments. I have chosen C++ for this purpose.

## Overview of Completed Work

Here is an overview of the assignments and my progress in the course:

 | #  | Homework      | A  | B  | C  | Î£   |
|----|---------------|----|----|----|-----|
| 1  | Linear Equations         | 6  | 3  | 1  | 10  |
| 2  | Eigenvalues           | 6  | 3  | 1  | 10   |
| 3  | Least-Squares  |6  | 3  | 1  | 10   |
| ...| ...           | ...| ...| ...| ... |
| **Total Points** | | | | | **30** |

**Note:** The table above will be updated as I progress through the course. Each entry represents the points achieved in different parts of the homework, contributing to the final grade.

## Course Structure

The course spans several weeks, focusing initially on practical exercises and later shifting towards more comprehensive homework problems. Here's a brief overview:

- **Exercises Folder:** Contains 8 exercises covering the first 4 to 5 weeks of the course. Completion of these exercises is mandatory for eligibility to attend the final exam.
  
- **Homeworks Folder:** The latter part of the course is dedicated to homework problems. These assignments contribute up to 60% of the final grade, depending on the number of problems solved in each homework set.
