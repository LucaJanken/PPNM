--------------------Test Eigenvalue Problem--------------------

Test Matrix H:
        4         1         1 
        1         3         1 
        1         1         2 

Step 1: Finding the smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the matrix H using the Rayleigh Quotient method...
Newton's method iterations: 229

Step 2: Output the smallest eigenvalue.
Smallest Eigenvalue: 1.324869129

Step 3: Output the corresponding eigenvector.
Corresponding Eigenvector: -0.172147674 -0.427132160 0.887650436 

Step 4: Verify and output the normalization of the eigenvector.
Norm of the Eigenvector: 1.000000000 (should be close to 1.0)

Step 5: Compute the product H * v, where v is the eigenvector.
H * v: -0.228072420 -0.565893717 1.176021038 

Step 6: Compute the product lambda * v, where lambda is the smallest eigenvalue and v is the eigenvector.
lambda * v: -0.228073139 -0.565894213 1.176020660 

Step 7: Verification.
The values of 'H * v' and 'lambda * v' should be close to each other.
'H * v' represents the matrix-vector multiplication of H with the eigenvector v.
'lambda * v' represents the scalar multiplication of the eigenvalue with the eigenvector v.
If the values match closely, it confirms that the computed eigenpair is correct.
